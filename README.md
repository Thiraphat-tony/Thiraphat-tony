## About Me
- 🎮 Interested in **game development** and **VR / Interactive Media**
- 🧩 Enjoy building **systems**, **tools**, and **clean workflows**
- 🧠 Strong focus on usability and real-world constraints (including accessibility / elder-friendly UI)

---

## Featured Projects
### ✅ Production / Real Operations
- **Seminar Check-in System (Next.js + Supabase)**  
  Built for real seminar operations: registration → QR attendee page → admin dashboard → export workflows  
  Repo: https://github.com/thiraphat_tony/seminar-checkin

### 🎮 Game / VR (WIP / Coming soon)
- **UE5 Gameplay Prototype (WIP)** — combat feel, camera/lock-on, input + animation experiments  
  Repo: (add link)
- **VR Interaction Experiments (WIP)** — grab/interaction patterns, UX testing  
  Repo: (add link)

> Tip: If you have a short demo video, add it here — it boosts credibility instantly.

## Tech Stack
**Game / VR**
- Unreal Engine 5 (learning & prototyping)
- VR interaction & UX thinking

**Web / Backend**
- Next.js (App Router), TypeScript
- Supabase (Postgres, Storage, Auth)
- Deployment: Vercel / Docker (as needed)

## Highlights
- ✅ Built a scalable check-in system designed for large events (~1,400 attendees)
- ✅ Admin workflows: search/filter, check-in controls, slip handling, export-ready outputs
- ✅ Iterative engineering: shipping features, refining UX, and improving reliability

## What I’m focusing on now
- Combat feel & responsiveness (timing, feedback, camera rules)
- VR interaction patterns & usability
- System reliability for real events (load testing, backup workflows, clarity-first UI)
